This repository contains the image processing codes with a detailed concept explanation using the OpenCV library written in python.

Here is the list of image processing algorithms explained with the code:

1.Log transfomation 

2.Power Law Transformation 

3.Contrast Stretching 

4.Histogram Equalization 

5.Intensity Level Slicing.

6.Bitplane Slicing.

7.Arithmatic operations for image enhancement.

8.Finding edges using Canny edge detector.

9.Spatial domain to frequenct domain conversion.
